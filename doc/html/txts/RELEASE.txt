RELEASE NOTES

A sparse state-space and model order reduction toolbox developed at the 
Chair of Automatic Control, Technische Universitaet Muenchen.

Programmed and tested with: MATLAB R2015b.

The sssMOR toolbox was programmed and tested with MATLAB R2015b. The 
toolbox might also work for previous releases of MATLAB, but perhaps 
some functionalities get lost (no warranty).

However, in order to be able to install the toolbox, you need the Add-On 
Explorer, for which the Add-Ons icon is required. Therefore, you need at least
to have the MATLAB R2014b version installed on your computer before installing
the sssMOR toolbox.

At least required version: MATLAB R2014b.
